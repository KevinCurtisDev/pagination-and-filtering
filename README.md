## Features

Pagination:
A list of students of any length is loaded. The list is split into pages  that display 10 entries at most. Users can page through the list by clicking on page links. Doing this dynamically populates the display with entries associated with the page clicked.

Filtering:
A search box allows users to filter the list of entries based on the name of each entry. As a search term is typed into the search bar, the list of entries dynamically populates the page with matching entries.
